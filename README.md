# Description

We created a job explorer website called iTakeoff for people who are new to tech and would like to learn more about some of the most popular jobs in the tech industry. iTakeoff is designed to help anyone interested in learning more about a few career options in tech. We put together an assessment quiz that allows people to identify their strongest skills and find a job best suited for them in the tech industry. Not only do we provide an assessment quiz, but we also have resources such as youtube videos that contain information about each job position.
